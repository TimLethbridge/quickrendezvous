# Quickrendezvous

This a Web tool to quickly but fairly book an appointment from a set of appointments.

It is intended to help during the Covid-19 pandemic, to handle such use cases as:

  * Booking Covid-19 testing appointments at a particular testing site (it is particularly suited for pop-up sites, so there need not be any physical lineups).
  * Booking consultations with a teacher or professor (office hours)
  * Booking vaccinations
  * Booking appointments at recreational, cultural or commercial facilities, where the number of people present at a time must be controlled

It is currently under development so should not be used with live data until this line is removed.

It is fully open source, so can be installed on a private server. However there is a canonical implementation on the web at https://quickrendezvous.org Additional details can be found by visiting that site. 

For private installations, the only dependency is PhP. 

This site is part of a research project at the University of Ottawa, and is intended for study by students.

Contributions are welcome.
