<h1> &nbsp; Quick Rendezvous</h1>

<p>Welcome to the QuickRendezvous appointment reservation system (under development).</p>

<p>This has been designed to allow management of huge queues where people need quick appointments as soon as possible that last a relatively short time. Appointments are set up first-come-first-served.</p>

<p>Possible uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Booking Covid-19 testing appointments at a particular testing site (it is particularly suited for pop-up sites, so there need not be any physical lineups).
<li>Booking consultations with a teacher or professor (office hours)
<li>Booking vaccinations
<li>Booking appointments at recreational, cultural or commercial facilities, where the number of people present at a time must be controlled
</ul>

<p>If you have a queue link, you can request an appointment by providing your name, email and phone number. Please <b>do not click on a link to use a queue unless you trust the source of the link</b>, since you don't want to give your information to an untrusted source. In other words only follow links to queues from known websites.</p>

<p>The following link will take you to a practice queue where you can book pretend appointments and learn how the system works.</p>

<a href="?queuename=default&lang=en" class="button2">Try the practice queue</a>.

<p>Anyone can click below to create a queue and send or post the link. The queue manager will be provided with a secret link to set up available appointments and view the people who have booked.</p>

<p>Special features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Appointments can be set for any number of days in the future, but past ones disappear.
<li>Appointments can be automatically generated for the same time period each day, or different time periods on different days.
<li>New appointments can be added by the queue manager (e.g. if extra capacity becomes available).
<li>People always get the first available appointment by default, but can request to try to switch it to an earlier or later one. For example, an earlier appointment might become available due to a cancellation.
<li>This is designed for very fast response time.
<li>If there are no appointments, the system will allow requestors to try again later.
<li>Appointments can be generated gradually over time, preventing a rush (as would be the case if all tickets were released at the same time)
<li>The person managing a queue can allow multiple appointments at the same time if they so choose (e.g. for a recreational facility).
<li>The number of available appointments at different periods of time in the future is visible to users.
<li>The queue manager can embed their own logo and text in their page.
</ul>

<p>Future extensions planned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verification of email address or phone number before an appointment can be booked (not free).
<li>Ability for the queue manager to specify the type of information to be gathered when a person requests an appointment.
<li>Making the site more pretty (without compromising its speed).
</ul>

<p>This software is <a href="https://github.com/TimLethbridge/quickrendezvous" target="gh">open source on GitHub</a> so it can be installed on anybody's private server.</p>
